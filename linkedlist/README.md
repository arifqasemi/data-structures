Usages of  LinkedList in software engineering

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
   Example: An online ticket booking system where the number of tickets can vary based on the number of users booking tickets simultaneously.
2. Implementation of Other Data Structures with Linkedlist:
    Stacks:
    Example: Implementing a browser's back button functionality where the most recently visited page needs to be accessed first.
    Queues:
    Example: Managing print jobs in a printer queue where the first job sent to the printer is the first to be printed.
    Graphs:
    Example: Representing a social network where each user is a node, and friendships are edges represented using adjacency lists.
3. Handling Large Datasets:

    Example: Managing a music playlist where users can frequently add, remove, or reorder songs.
4. Efficient Insertions/Deletions:
    
    Example: Implementing a text editor where characters or lines can be inserted or deleted rapidly without the need to shift other characters

5. Memory Management:

    Example: The free memory list in an operating system that keeps track of all the free memory blocks.     

6. Chained Hash Tables:

    Example: A hash table to store student records, where students with the same hash value are stored in a linked list at that hash index.   

7. Navigating Backward and Forward:

    Example: Implementing the undo and redo functionality in a text editor where actions can be reversed and reapplied

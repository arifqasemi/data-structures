1. Undirected Graph:

    Description: In this graph, edges have no direction. If there is an edge between two vertices, you can traverse it in both directions.
    Example: Friendship networks where the relationship is mutual.

2. Directed Graph (Digraph):

    Description: This graph has edges with a direction, meaning each edge goes from one vertex to another specific vertex.
    Example: Twitter following, where the relationship is one-way.

3. Weighted Graph:

    Description: Edges in this graph have weights, representing some cost, distance, or any other metric.
    Example: Road networks where edges have weights indicating distances or travel time.

4. Unweighted Graph:

    Description: Edges do not have weights; all edges are considered equal.
    Example: Simple social networks where the presence of a connection is the only information.

5. Connected Graph:

    Description: There is a path between any two vertices in the graph.
    Example: A network where every node can communicate with any other node.

6. Disconnected Graph:

    Description: Not all vertices are connected; some vertices cannot be reached from others.
    Example: Separate subnetworks in a larger network.

7. Cyclic Graph:

    Description: This graph contains at least one cycle, a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
    Example: Computer networks with redundant paths to ensure reliability.

8. Acyclic Graph:

    Description: This graph does not contain any cycles.
    Example: Task scheduling where tasks are dependent on the completion of other tasks.

9. Tree:

    Description: A special type of acyclic, connected graph where there is exactly one path between any two vertices.
    Example: Organizational hierarchies, file systems.

10. Forest:

    Description: A collection of disjoint trees.
    Example: Multiple disconnected organizational structures.

11. Bipartite Graph:

    Description: Vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
    Example: Job assignments where jobs are connected to people.

12. Complete Graph:

    Description: There is an edge between every pair of vertices.
    Example: A fully connected network.

13. Sparse Graph:

    Description: A graph with relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.
    Example: Social networks where users have few connections.

14. Dense Graph:

    Description: A graph with a large number of edges compared to the number of vertices.
    Example: Airline routes between major airports.

15. Planar Graph:

    Description: A graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.
    Example: Geographical maps where regions are connected by borders.

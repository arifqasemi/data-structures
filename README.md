Sure, here's a list of common operations for various data structures:

1. Arrays
    Access: Accessing elements by index.
    Insertion: Inserting elements at a specific position.
    Deletion: Deleting elements from a specific position.
    Traversal: Iterating through all elements.
    Search: Finding the index of a specific element.
2. Linked Lists
    Insertion: Inserting elements at the beginning, end, or specific position.
    Deletion: Deleting elements from the beginning, end, or specific position.
    Traversal: Iterating through all elements.
    Search: Finding a specific element.
    Reversal: Reversing the linked list.
3. Stacks
    Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
    Pop: Removing the top element from the stack.
    Peek: Viewing the top element without removing it.
    IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.
    Size: Getting the number of elements in the stack.
4. Queues
    Enqueue: Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
    Dequeue: Removing an element from the front of the queue.
    Peek/Front: Viewing the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
    IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.
    Size: Getting the number of elements in the queue.
5. Hash Tables
    Insertion: Adding a key-value pair to the hash table.
    Deletion: Removing a key-value pair from the hash table.
    Search: Finding the value associated with a given key.
    Collision Handling: Resolving collisions that occur when two keys hash to the same index.
    Load Factor: Monitoring the ratio of filled slots to total slots.
6. Trees
    Insertion: Adding a node to the tree.
    Deletion: Removing a node from the tree.
    Traversal: Visiting all nodes in the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
    Search: Finding a specific node in the tree.
    Height/Depth: Finding the height or depth of the tree.
7. Graphs
    Add Vertex: Adding a vertex (node) to the graph.
    Remove Vertex: Removing a vertex from the graph.
    Add Edge: Adding an edge between two vertices.
    Remove Edge: Removing an edge between two vertices.
    Traversal: Visiting all vertices in the graph (BFS, DFS).
